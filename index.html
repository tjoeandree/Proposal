          <h2>Phase 1 - Design Interview</h2>
          <p>
          The first order of business is to sit down with your team and create a detailed set of design and technical specifications. These
            specifications serve as a roadmap for the rest of the web design process.
          </p>

        <h2>Phase 2 - Mockup Presentation</h2>
        <p>
          2 new mockup will be designed, each mockup will have 5 essential page, this mockup are your first chance to visualize your website. While
          they're not nearly as detailed as the final site will be, they give us a visual representation of the site's overall layout. At this phase
          you will be able to pick one of the mockup and request revisions.
        </p>

        <h2>Phase 3 - Prototype Showcase</h2>
        <p>
          Once the mockup is agreed on, we'll then turn the mockup into interactive prototype that will allow you click through the website and
          experience it as if it was live. At this phase you will be able to request revisions.

    <h2>Revision Rounds</h2>
    <p>
      The revision process of the mockup or in prototype phase of your website is a collaborative one. It is where you can guide the design and
      request changes. In order for this process to work well we ask you to please be considerate of the following guidelines regarding the
      revision process.
      <ul>
        <li>You can submit up to 3 revision rounds for your website<br>
          Please take the time to carefully review the website designs and make your revision requests as thorough as possible. Additional revision rounds charged at IDR 1.000.000 per round.</li>
        <li>Please submit each round of revision to us in a single email<br>
          It doesnâ€™t work effectively for us to receive multiple emails with small revision in each one. Please compile all your thoughts and requests for the revision in one email. And please attach any relevant images or documents to the email.</li>
        <li>Revision scope<br>
          You may request changes object position, fonts and colour.</li>
        <li>Out of scope requests<br>
          If you require additional web mockup that are not part of your scoped and quoted website package we maybe able to add these at an additional charge IDR 3.000.000.</li>
      </ul>
